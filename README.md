# Solana Program Calling in React

This project is a web application designed to interact with Solana smart contracts using the Phantom wallet. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The application fetches data from the Solana blockchain, updates the UI with calculation results, and provides buttons for users to perform these operations.
